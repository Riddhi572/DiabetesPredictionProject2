# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes based on certain diagnostic measures. It utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to build a predictive model.

## Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Early detection of diabetes can help in effective management and prevention of complications. This project utilizes diagnostic measures such as glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy: NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for multidimensional arrays, mathematical functions, and random number generation, making it essential for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas: Pandas is a fast, powerful, and flexible library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures and functions to work with structured data, such as tables and time series data, making it ideal for data preprocessing and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, as well as tools for model selection and evaluation.
  - StandardScaler: StandardScaler is a preprocessing technique used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It is often used to preprocess numerical features before feeding them into machine learning models.
  - train_test_split: train_test_split is a function used to split datasets into training and testing sets. It is commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models on unseen data.
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine): SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space, making it suitable for binary classification tasks like diabetes prediction.
- Other libraries: The project may require additional libraries depending on specific functionalities and requirements.
